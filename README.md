# MyCamp
MyCamp is a Yelp inspired website where you can find campsites and leave reviews for them. Users are able to create new campsites and also create reviews and like other users reviews. Reviews utilize a star rating system that gives the average star rating of the campsite. Additonally there is a search feature that allows users to search campsites by name.
